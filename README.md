# Cartucho

A retro game emulator that allows you to play classic games directly in your browser, with ROMs and ISOs stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

## Demo

You can try out the emulator at [cartucho.vercel.app](https://cartucho.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Support for ROMs and ISOs:** Load games directly from IPFS.
- **Cross-Platform:** Play on any device with a modern browser.
- **Open Source:** Contribute and help improve the emulator.

## How It Works

The emulator uses IPFS technology to store and retrieve ROMs and ISOs, ensuring fast and decentralized access to games. This means you can share your ROMs with other users without relying on centralized servers.

Copy the CID generated by IPFS.
Enter the CID and select console to load the game.
